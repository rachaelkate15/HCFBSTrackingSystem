The main objective of the Humboldt County Farm Bureau Scholarship Tracker is be an interactive interface for both students and organization members to easily access, apply, and manage scholarships under helm of the Humboldt County Farm Bureau.

The web app utilizes NodeJS, React, MongoDB, HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a clean and straightforward environment for both students and organization members. The structure of the web app allow for easy use of CRUD operations for managing scholarships, applications and applicants.

Our goal with the design of the application is to allow the Humboldt County Farm Bureau to have an easily scalable and maintainable application.
